# Golang Code Base

## Overview
This project is a backend application developed using the **Golang** programming language. It leverages the **Echo framework** for building HTTP APIs and incorporates various tools and libraries to streamline development and improve efficiency. The workflow is designed to follow a **code-first approach** for database migration and utilizes **sqlc** for ORM functionalities, minimizing the need for manual repository or data-layer implementations.

## Features

### 1. **Echo Framework**
The Echo framework powers the HTTP server for this project. It provides robust and scalable routing capabilities to handle API endpoints efficiently.

### 2. **Code-First and Database Migration**
- Start with defining your data models in code.
- Use **golang-migrate** for generating and applying database migration files.
- Database schema is maintained and updated through migration files, ensuring consistency across environments.

### 3. **ORM with sqlc**
- **sqlc** is used for generating type-safe query methods based on SQL queries.
- No need to write separate repository or data layer files manually.
- Service-level integration enables seamless connection with the sqlc-generated repository.

### 4. **Payload Communication**
- Frontend and backend interact using structured payloads for both insertion and retrieval of data.
- Payloads can be manipulated to include additional parameters when inserting data into the database or formatting responses for the frontend.

### 5. **Makefile for Command Shortcuts**
This codebase includes a **Makefile** that provides shortcuts for commonly used commands, making it easier to manage tasks such as running the application, generating SQL code, and applying migrations.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Define Models and Queries
Begin by creating your SQL queries for all required operations in the database. Define your models and their relationships based on application needs.

### 2. Generate Database Migration Files
- Use **golang-migrate** to create migration files.
- Define your database structure in the generated migration files.
- Apply migrations to update the database schema as needed.

### 3. Generate ORM Code with sqlc
Run **sqlc** to generate Go code for database interactions based on the defined queries. This automates the creation of type-safe methods for performing CRUD operations and other queries.

### 4. Implement Service Layer
- Connect your sqlc-generated repository to the service layer.
- Add business logic to interact with the database and fulfill API requirements.

### 5. API Development
- Use the Echo framework to define routes and handlers for API endpoints.
- Ensure proper payload structures for both requests and responses.

### 6. Testing and Deployment
- Test the application to validate all APIs and database operations.
- Deploy the application following best practices for your chosen environment.

## Database Structure
The database structure is maintained in the migration files generated by **golang-migrate**. These files include:

- Table definitions
- Indexes
- Foreign key relationships
- Any other database constraints

Ensure that all changes to the database are made through migration files to maintain consistency and traceability.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. Setup the database:
   - Install **golang-migrate**.
   - Apply migrations:
     ```bash
     migrate -path ./migrations -database "<your_database_url>" up
     ```

4. Generate ORM code with sqlc:
   ```bash
   sqlc generate
   ```

5. Use the Makefile for task automation:
   ```bash
   make <target>
   ```
   Replace `<target>` with the desired command, such as `run`, `migrate-up`, or `sqlc-generate`.

6. Run the application:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
